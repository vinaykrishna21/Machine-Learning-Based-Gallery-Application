# Machine-Learning-Based-Gallery-Application

Machine Learning is used to make the gallery application more efficient to the user.

The main objective of this project is to develop a gallery application that uses Machine Learning to improve the user experience by using individual userâ€™s statistics to learn and display images according to his/her preference. Classifying images helps access similar images or images of the same kind together which makes it easier to view, modify or delete them. Further, among such categorized images, prioritization helps in quickly accessing images that the user needs often thus saving time. When there is a bulk of image data, these techniques help analyse and store them conveniently for later use.

To sum up, the aim of the project is to have a gallery app that classifies the very large number of images into a number of predefined classes or classes as determined by the users themselves and once the user enters a particular class, he/she is shown the images in the order of most important first i.e. the images that are more important to the particular user are shown earlier than those that are relatively less important.
